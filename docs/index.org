=QuasIncompact3D= is a Low Mach Number (LMN) solver implemented in the =Incompact3D= framework for
simulating low speed, turbulent flows with non-negligible density gradients.
Due to these density gradients, these flows are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations for
/compressible/ flows:
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial{}t} + \nabla\cdot\rho{}u &= 0 \\
\gamma{}M^2 \left( \frac{\partial\rho{}u}{\partial{}t} + \nabla\cdot\rho{}uu \right) &= -\nabla{}p + \frac{\gamma{}M^2}{Re} \nabla\cdot\tau \\
\frac{\partial{}T}{\partial{}t} + u\cdot\nabla{}T &= \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla\cdot\kappa\nabla{}T
\end{align}

* The Low Mach Number Approximation

The Low Mach Number approximation is developed for the case when changes in density cannot be
ignored, but the flow speed is low compared to the speed of sound, specifically: $\gamma{}M^2 \ll 1$.
Derivation of the LMN approximation proceeds by defining this new variable as $\varepsilon = \gamma{}M^2$ and
expanding the variables as a power series of it:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{u} = \textbf{u}^{\left( 0 \right)} + \varepsilon\textbf{u}^{\left( 1 \right)} + \varepsilon^2 \textbf{u}^{\left( 2 \right)} + \ldots
\end{equation}
Inserting these expansions into the governing equations and collecting only the lowest order terms
yields the following system of equations:
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\rho^{\left( 0 \right)}}{\partial{}t} + \nabla \cdot \rho^{\left( 0 \right)} \textbf{u}^{\left( 0 \right)} &= 0 \\
\textbf{0} &= \nabla{}p^{^\left( 0 \right)}
\end{align}
In the above equation system, there is no equation for velocity, the momentum equations have reduced
to: $\nabla{}p^{\left( 0 \right)} = 0$, so the first-order expansion of the momentum equations are taken,
giving:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho^{\left( 0 \right)}\textbf{u}^{\left( 0 \right)}}{\partial{}t} + \nabla \cdot \rho^{\left( 0 \right)}
\textbf{u}^{\left( 0 \right)} \textbf{u}^{\left( 0 \right)} = -\nabla p^{\left( 1 \right)} + \frac{1}{Re} \nabla \cdot
\tau^{\left( 0 \right)}
\end{equation}
